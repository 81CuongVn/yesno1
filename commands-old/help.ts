YesNo is super easy to use and requires no setup. To create a poll, mention the bot (\`@YesNo\`) and ask the question. For example: \`@YesNo is YesNo the best bot?\`. Polls will be pinned to the channel so people can easily find them.

You can close a poll (which will unpin it and send the results) by ${slashCommandsAdded ? 'using `/' : 'sending `yn.'}close\`.

To get YesNo update notifications delivered to this channel, ${slashCommandsAdded ? 'use `/' : 'send `yn.'}subscribe\`.

YesNo now has [Slash Commands](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501)${slashCommandsAdded ? '! YesNo slash commands are already enabled for this server, type `/` to try them out!' : `, but they aren't enabled on this server yet!
