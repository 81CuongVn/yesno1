      title: "YesNo Help",
      description: `YesNo is a simple yes/no poll bot created by [advaith](https://advaith.io). It is based on the YesNo bot built in to [Google Allo](https://allo.google.com), which shut down in March 2019.

YesNo is super easy to use and requires no setup. To create a poll, mention the bot (\`@YesNo\`) and ask the question. For example: \`@YesNo is YesNo the best bot?\`. Polls will be pinned to the channel so people can easily find them.

You can close a poll (which will unpin it and send the results) by using \`/close\`.

To get YesNo update notifications delivered to this channel, use \`/subscribe\`.
